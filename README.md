challenge 1: refactoring Horiseon marketing code for accessibility 
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

In this challenge I took existing code from Horiseon marketing agency's website and refactored it to meet accessibility criteria. I also corrected some issues and cleaned up the code by consolidating repetitive sections. I learned about symantic elements in HTML and more about class attributes as well as IDs. This website did not change visually from the starter code, however as seen in the pictures it still opens normally.
